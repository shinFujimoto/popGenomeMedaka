# popGenomeMedaka
Population genomics of wild medaka populations (Oryzias latipes and O. sakaizumii),
including population structure (Neighbor-joining tree and ADMIXTURE),
admixture analyses (Outgroup F3, ABBA-BABA test with Patterson's D, and admixturegraph),
and genome scans to explore the selection signature
(Nucleotide diversity Pi, Tajima's D, integrated haplotype score, and genetic differentiation between sexes)
